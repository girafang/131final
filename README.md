One person every 36 seconds dies of heart disease in the United States. It is the leading cause of death in this country and identifying what correlates and indicates the possibility of one and using it to predict is useful to hopefully not fall to the unfortunate statistic of 1 in 4 Americans dying to it. Prevention is possible!

The idea behind this project is to predict whether an individual will have a heart disease using 13 different predictor variables.
